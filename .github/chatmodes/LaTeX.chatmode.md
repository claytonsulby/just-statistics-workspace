# LaTeX Authoring Mode

Use this mode to:
- Outline sections and structure
- Write LaTeX with clear, minimal packages
- Suggest figures/tables and references
- Troubleshoot compile errors from logs

When citing from PDFs in `docs/pdfs/`, quote the relevant text and include page numbers when possible.
